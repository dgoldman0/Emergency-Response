# Emergency-Response

 A Platform for Supporting First Responders and Disaster Relief

Emergency services and disaster relief are one of the most important activities in the world. Humanity is under constant threat from nature, and from itself. There is always a need for poeple who can quickly respond to provide aid to those who need it. Unfortunately, much of these services are provided by volunteers, and even paid workers often receive very little. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/10/18/the-25-most-underpaid-jobs-in-america/#3f5f716b260f), Emergency Medical Technician is one of the most underpaid of all jobs, with a median salary of just $27,636 a year.

# Certification

While there are a number of certifications related to emergency response and disaster relief, we will be offering our own certification. This certification is not a license and is not issued by any government service. It is also not recognized by government services. However, we plan on accepting government issued certifications and licenses towards our certification, as well as providing training that can lead to such certifications and licenses.

## Basic

In order to receive the basic certification, individuals will have to show competency in CPR and basic understanding of disaster management.

## Intermediate

In order to receive the intermediate certification, individuals will need to complete the requirements for basic certification and must show competency in emergency medical response and amateur radio operation, and must complete at least 10 continuing education hours, relating to disaster relief, public health, medicine, and/or engineering.

## Advanced

In order to receive the intermediate certification, individuals will need to complete the requirements for intermediate certification and must show advanced understanding in emergency preparedness and amateur radio operation, and 25 continuing education hours (not in addition to the 10 from the intermediate requirements), relating to disaster relief, public health, medicine, and/or engineering.

## Recertification

CPR, emergency medical response, and amateur radio certifications will have to be maintained each year for the certification to remain valid. Continuing education requirements will evaluated biannually.

## Volunteer Work

This is an early draft of the ideas set forth for this project. We are also considering a requirement to actually volunteer a certain number of hours each year. However, we haven't worked out the logistics of such requirements.

### Thought Process

While we fully expect those who have received these certifications to actively help out in a time of need, and there is certainly no free ride because of the amount of involvement in obtaining anything more than the basic certification, the goal is to ensure that we are supporting those who are actively involved in disaster relief.

# Tokenization

World Builder is creating an ecosystem of cryptographic tokens. While "crypto" is a hot buzzword, it offers a lot of potential to monetize activities that are traditionally difficult to monetize, including emergency response. The goal is to create a token that maintains a value of roughly 0.50 USD (2020 PPP).

# Distribution

After certification, a person will receive a certain amount of EMR (emergency response) tokens each month. These tokens will be useful for paying for a number of services and purchasing a number of items related to emergency response. Tokens will be distributed based on the level of certification.

Basic: 50 tokens per month
Intermediate: 2500 tokens per month
Advanced: 10,000 tokens per month

# Services

One of the goals of this operation is to provide services to first responders, including initial and continuing education. We plan on providing CPR, EMS, and other forms of training. We are hopeful that we will also provide enough courses so that any continuing education requirements can be completed through us. We will accept EMR tokens as payment for these programs.

## Shop

We plan on offering a number of products which can be purchased using EMR, including educational material such as books related to emergency response, amateur radio equipment, as well as other disaster preparedness supplies, including MREs (meals ready to eat).
